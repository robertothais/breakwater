# ASTx Environment Variable Extraction - Industrial Espionage Disguised as Banking Security

## CRITICAL FINDING: Process Environment Variable Harvesting

**Function:** FUN_080c8718 â†’ `extractEnvironmentVariablesFromAllUserProcesses`
**Attack Surface:** Complete process environment variable extraction

## The Shell Command of Corporate Espionage

```bash
ps -u 'USERNAME' -o pid= | xargs -I{} cat /proc/{}/environ 2>/dev/null | tr '\0' '\n' | grep '^ENV_VAR=' | cut -d= -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### What This Command Does:
1. **Lists ALL process IDs** for the target user
2. **Reads `/proc/PID/environ`** for EVERY running process 
3. **Extracts specific environment variables** from all processes
4. **Counts and ranks** the extracted values

### What Gets Extracted:
- **API Keys & Tokens** - AWS_ACCESS_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN, etc.
- **Database Credentials** - Connection strings, passwords
- **Development Secrets** - NODE_ENV configs, Rails secrets
- **Corporate Configurations** - Company-specific environment variables
- **Personal Tokens** - Authentication tokens, service keys
- **Software Licensing** - License keys, activation tokens
- **Custom Tooling** - Development environment configurations

## This is INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE

Korean banks are forcing customers to install software that:
- **Harvests secrets from ALL running processes**
- **Extracts corporate development credentials**
- **Collects personal API keys and tokens**
- **Maps entire development environments**
- **Steals software licensing information**

### Example Compromised Data:
```bash
# Developer environment - ALL EXTRACTED:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/db
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
JWT_SECRET=super_secret_key_here
```

### Corporate Impact:
- **Trade secrets** in development environment variables
- **Internal API endpoints** and credentials
- **Database connection strings** with embedded passwords
- **Third-party service credentials**
- **Software licensing violations** through key extraction

## Security Implications

1. **Mass Credential Harvesting** - Every Korean banking customer's secrets extracted
2. **Corporate Espionage** - Company development credentials compromised
3. **Supply Chain Attacks** - Harvested credentials enable downstream attacks
4. **Industrial Surveillance** - Complete mapping of corporate development environments

## Legal Implications

This level of data extraction without explicit consent for SECRET HARVESTING (not just "anti-virus scanning") may violate:
- **Corporate data protection policies**
- **International trade secret laws**
- **Developer privacy rights**
- **Software licensing agreements**

## Conclusion

ASTx isn't just surveillance software - it's **industrial espionage malware** disguised as banking security. Korean banks are forcing customers to install **credential harvesting software** that extracts secrets from every running process.

This is potentially the **most serious security violation** we've discovered - systematic extraction of secrets, API keys, and corporate credentials from millions of Korean banking customers under the false pretense of "virus protection."

**Every developer, corporation, and software company with users in Korea should be aware that their secrets may be compromised by mandatory banking "security" software.**
